My name is Donovan Livingston and I came to address you in the best way. I know how but you have to forgive me. I have to take this moment in for a little while when I spoke when I spoke in my high school graduation several years ago my high school English teacher threatened to replace me on the program or cut my microphone when she found out that I was interested in doing a phone as a part of my remarks. So I am internally grateful for being able to share this piece of myself. I'm I'm also sending voice with you this afternoon so spoken word poetry.it is Kiss on participation so if you feel so compelled snap class throw up your hands Rejoice celebrate class of 2016 this is your address and this is your day education then beyond all other devices of human origin it's a great equalizer of the conditions of men Horace Mann 1848 at the time of his remark
