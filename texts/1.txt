In Dhaka dice, I did a quote for a cake at a conference for this big company who made in South and salt accounting software. In a bit, I presume to inspire the sales people to Greater Heights that folks out 12 grand for an inspirational speaker. Who is this extreme sports guy who had had a couple of his limbs Frozen off when he got stuck on a Ledge on some Mountain. It was weird software sales people. I think need to hear from someone has had a long success.happy career in software Styles not from an overly optimistic X Mountaineer some pool guy who had arrived in the morning. Hoping to learn more about sales techniques ended up going home worried about the blood flow to his extremities. It's not inspirational. It's confusing. And it's the mountain was meant to be a symbol of life challenges in the loss of Limbs and metaphor for sacrifice the software guys not going to get it busy cuz you didn't do an ass degraded.Good.
